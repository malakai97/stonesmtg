# Invites

Invites to the players who will qualify for the Invitational are given out for:

* 1 invite to last season's invitational champion
* Winning a single-day or league event (other than the Festival of Friendship)

Players can never earn more than one invitation. Thus, if a player who is already
invited places 1st at an event, the invitation for that event would go to the 2nd place
finisher. If that player is also already invited, 3rd and 4th place will face off for
the invite.
