### The Dance Party returns!

* **Format:** Middle School, using Eternal Central’s deck construction and play
  rules (i.e. mana burn, damage on the stack, and original Wish functionality).
  Rules can be found on the Lords of the Pit website:
  https://lordsofthepit.com/formats#middle-school-rules, 
* **Location:** webcams! 
* **Entry:** RSVP to romancingthestonesmtg@gmail.com by Friday, January 30th. When you
  RSVP, please include both your real name and Discord handle in the body of the email. 
* **Proxy Limit:** 100% proxy. Please make your proxies clear so opponents
  can easily identify them over webcam. One card that is just sharpie'd on is fine, but
  60 of them is a psychic assault.
* **Decklists:** send a decklist to romancingthestonesmtg@gmail.com prior to your first
  match the week of February 2nd. At the end of the league, we’ll ask for delicious
  deck photos to share on our site., 
* **Structure**: X Swiss Rounds with a cut to Top 8. Players will have 1 week to
  coordinate and play each match. Round 1 kicks off Monday, February 2nd.
