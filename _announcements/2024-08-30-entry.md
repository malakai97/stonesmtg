* **Location**: Rudyard’s Pub (2010 Waugh Dr, Houston TX)
* **Time**: 11:00am registration, 11:30am start
* **Proxy Limit**: 100% proxy, both days! Please make good, full-color,
  easily-identifiable proxies (don't make me have to do fuss at you).
* **Entry for Old School**: $20 cash or PayPal for Saturday + an Old School Legal card
  worth ~$5 or a few cards worth $5 in total (please make them all playables no laces!)
  these will be put into the prize pool for the next Texas event so we can stamp them
