Romancing the Stones is going through some changes. One of our two primary
organizers moved to Connecticut this summer, and the other one is increasingly
busy with other commitments. As a result, we’re trying to adopt a new, looser
approach to our events: just because we’ve done something one way in the past
doesn’t mean we’re locked into that way of doing things!

This year’s Fall Semester was run with that mantra in mind. We were behind on
holding a league, to the point that had we launched one in November it wouldn’t
have been completed in time for the December Invitational. So, we pivoted.
Rather than play six rounds over six weeks, we ran the Fall Semester as a
single-day tournament.
[We did this a few times](/results/2020-11-14/)
[in the early days of the pandemic](/results/2021-01-20/),
but haven’t returned to that format for several years.

16 players came out to give it a try with us. We deeply appreciate that
commitment from every one of them: that meant spending a good six hours at
their computers, and for our West Coast and Japanese players, it also meant
playing at brutal hours.

In the interest of giving everyone the most Magic for their buck (not that
there was an entry fee), we played 5 rounds of swiss and cut to Top 4. It was
an exciting finals, with Brian Espinoza coming out on top with his BW
Control/Deadguy list. Congrats Brian on the win and earning our penultimate
Invitational spot!

For an experiment, the Fall Semester wound up being a really fun day. While
we’ll absolutely be running 3 of our classic leagues in 2026, this went well
enough that we’d like to mix in a few more of these one-day digital events.
Thanks everyone for making it a good time!
