It’s December, the days are getting shorter, the weather cooler, and Romancing the
Stones’s fifth season has come to its close. Per tradition, we capped our year with
the Invitational: part intense competitive event, part party, all a celebration of
Magic as we like to experience it.

The Invitational is truly a community effort. RTS co-founder Brian Tweedy not only
provided his venue and breakfast tacos for the players, he also hosted our stream all
day! He was joined in the booth by Initiative-enthusiast Brian Espinoza, along with a
rotating cast of friends supporting. Shoutout to both Brians for donating their time
and energy to hosting – talking about Magic intelligently and engagingly for 8 hours
is no small feat! And on the subject of the stream: Rob Connolly not only played in the
Invitational, he also set up the hardware for the entire streaming process, tweaking
stuff and working through IT issues until the very minute we kicked off. The videos
should be up on our channel, so do yourself a favor and spend an afternoon watching
the event. Twitch.tv/romancingthestones

One other man’s fingerprints were all over the Invitational. Bobby Scheidemann designs
all our proxy trophy cards, including this year’s incredible baseball field
Tolarian Academy, which ties together this season’s baseball trophies:

Not only that, but Bobby also spent all day hanging out and taking professional-grade
photography of the event! So if you enjoy the visual component of this writeup and our
whole scene, you have Bobby to thank.

On the competitive side of things, our 10 invitees this year were:

The tournament was 6 rounds of Swiss (3 Vintage, followed by 3 Middle School) followed
by a cut to Top 4 (Vintage). Decklists can be seen by following the links next to each

All the invitees played on some great games, but after the Swiss, we cut to a Top 4
of Paul (Beseech Combo), Bo (Atraxa Oath), Stu (5C Engineer), and Hockey (Esper Pile).

There was a lot on the line with this one. Brian Hockey has won 3 of our 4
Invitationals, and if he took this down too, we’d have to seriously consider putting
Romancing The Stones out of its misery and just starting a Hockey Patreon. When he
defeated Paul in the semis, it was looking like that might be a reality. Stu took
infinite turns effectively against Bo, and we had our finalists:

The games were something – please check out the videos for a good sense of what
Engineer can do. Stu took it down in 2, saving the community from total humiliation
and earning himself the title of 2023 Romancing The Stones Champion!

As always, the Invitational was a perfect end to a great season. Now we’re off to
Pittsburgh to for North American Vintage Champs!
