Welcome to our 6th annual year-end Invitational!

We approached this year’s Invitational a little differently and more
indulgently than in previous years. As some of our core players have moved away
from Austin and we’ve built a wider community through our webcam leagues, we
wanted to make the Invitational an all-weekend event worth traveling for. To
make that happen, we rented a large Airbnb to party and sleep at. That was a
great double-sided sword: Friday night was an awesome hang, but about a third
of our field was hungover for the event itself! Oh well – we’re all consenting
adults here.

On that note, this was our most travel-heavy Invitational yet. Ty Thomason and
Galen Lemei flew in, while Chase Hoppe, Ben Kendrick, Rob Wilson, and Dan Ersch
all drove from greater Texas. Likewise, longtime players Bryan Hockey and Mike
O’Malley flew out just to hang! We can’t express our gratitude enough for you
guys making the trip.

As always, the Invitational was a group effort. Brian Tweedy hosted us at his
namesake bar, while Rob Connolly gave hours of time to set up our world-class
stream. Kai Schafroth donated a print to the prize pool (“Vintage events are
supposed to have art”), and many players came by to hang out, hop in the booth,
and help clean up. All of this put together made it a really special event.

Per previous years, the tournament was open-decklist: players submitted lists
the Wednesday beforehand, and then had 48 hours to study their competition. We
played 3 rounds of Vintage, followed by 3 rounds of Middle School, with a cut
to Top 4 Vintage. This made for a long, dramatic, and challenging day for our
12 Invitees.

As noted above,
[the entire event was streamed on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/romancingthestones)!
This is a good time to reiterate our
gratitude to Rob Connolly: Rob puts a huge amount of work into our stream, and
in addition to making our scene accessible to people outside Austin, this also
serves as perfect documentation for our tournaments. So if text ain’t doing it
for you, go check out the replay of the stream and see some great games.

When the swiss ended, we cut to our Top 4: Galen, Ty, Rob Wilson, and Chase. On
one side of the bracket, Ty’s Atraxas quickly dispatched Rob’s Bowmasters. On
the other side, the Doomsday vs Combo Dredge match was bombastic, and
ultimately Chase dredged his way to the finals.

This year’s finals was as dramatic as we could hope for. Ty is a veteran ringer
of both the pro scene and Old School communities, while this year Chase has
notched up 2nd place finishes at The Land Run and Vintage Champs! Normally Oath
tends to run Dredge over, but Chase’s combo build lets him ignore Atraxa and
win the game via Thassa’s Oracle. We got an incredible, tense 3 games,
culminating in Dredge mulling to 2 . . . and winning! Great games, guys, and
congrats to our 2024 Season Champion: Chase Hoppe!

This event comes pretty damn close to hitting on the perfect formula for the
Invitational, and is likely going to serve as the template for next year’s. It
was a great capstone to an awesome season, and we’re excited to see y’all back
in 2025.
