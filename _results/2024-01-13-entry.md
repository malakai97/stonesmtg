The Festival of Friendship debuted
[all the way back in 2019]( https://stonesmtg.com/results/2019-01-20/) as one of our
first-ever Old School events. The Festival
[returned digitally two years later]( https://stonesmtg.com/results/2021-01-20/), and
has been dormant since then. After the success of
[the Hurricane last year]( https://stonesmtg.com/results/2022-09-17/), we started talking
to the Falling Stars about hosting another Old School/Vintage double header to kick off
the 2024 season. And with that, the Festival of Friendship was back!

On Saturday we met at Tweedy’s for Old School. We decided to try the permissive Boreal
ruleset, so players could run their full set of Recalls, Mazes of Ith, etc. All entry
fees went to the Central Texas Food Bank, but players were swagged out with signed
participation cards, Top 8 prizes, and custom Orc Army tokens and CoP Black coasters.
On top of that, our friend from San Antonio Billy Palmer donated a set of graded Alpha
and Beta cards, and local Ian Files donated a pile of FBB cards:

Rob Connolly generously gave up playing to live stream both days. All told, that was
over thirteen hours in the booth!

On Sunday we returned to Tweedy’s for Vintage! Less charity, more cash, plus the winner
was set to take home an incredible lo-fi Mox Emerald and a spot at the 2024 Invitational.

We had 19 players for Vintage, good for 5 rounds followed by a cut to Top 8. Rob was
joined in the stream by Ruby.
Paul Garrett put up a good fight with UB Lurrus, but new member of the scene Justin
Bruce won it all with his awesome Tezzerator Jewel Shops list!

The whole weekend was a triumphant return for the Festival of Friendship name. Can’t
wait to do it again in 2027!
