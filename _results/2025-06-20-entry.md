How poetic: as students around the country are heading back to their
classrooms, we just wrapped up the School’s Out league. 38 mages spent their
summer vacations together playing Middle School.

We had a fascinating Top 8 this league, filled with many familiar faces.
Landstill and Sligh made up half the field – no surprises there! But Dragon and
Replenish both represented combo, while Wizards and Clerics were great tribal
brews.

After Pete Simpson’s finals run with Living Death ZI last league, Brian
Lonergan’s 2nd-place finish with Clerics this time makes a pretty convincing
argument for Mono Black. But it was Masayuki’s UW Replenish that took down the
whole thing – a great performance, and Masa’s second league win!

We should be back in a few weeks with the Fall Semester league to round out the
MS season. Get your back-to-school shopping done, and see y’all soon!
