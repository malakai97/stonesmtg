For Easter Saturday we hopped over to Kinda Tropical. Getting back to KT has
been a long time coming: it was our original venue for
[RTS36 before getting rained out](https://stonesmtg.com/results/2025-02-23/),
and we nearly got rained out for RTS37, too!

Rob Connolly is busy being a new dad, but he had time to swing by and donate 5
amazing foil-peel proxies we door prized throughout the day. We also had a
sealed pack of Easter cards for 9th place. To top it off, we had a playset of
beautiful Lo-Fi Coveted Jewels, designed by Bobby Scheidemann, for 1st place.

Top 8 was pretty cool, featuring 2 different Combo Dredge lists and 00s
throwback Gifts Ungiven! Fittingly, Ryan Bartley took it down. Ryan’s been
registering Jewel Shops variants at our events for the past season or two, so
we couldn’t be happier to see him bring home the Jewel trophies!
