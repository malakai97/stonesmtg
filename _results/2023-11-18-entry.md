This past Saturday, Romancing the Stones 31 closed out our 2023 open season. One of our
regulars, Curt Christian, reached out to us asking if he could host: he’s the head
brewer at Texas Sake Company, and we immediately excepted! 18 players made their way to
South Austin and spent the day enjoying rice-based beverages and Spam rolls. It was a
great spot that we’d love to return to for a future event.

18 players was good for 5 rounds and a cut to Top 8, which made for a pretty long day
and lots of good Magic played.

We had lots of special treats throughout the day. Bobby Scheidemann, who designs all
our trophy cards, brought along his camera and took great pictures of the event,
including some artful player portraits:

In addition, John Thomas donated a set of Magic-inspired paintings to the Top 4!

Per tradition for our final event of the season, both 1st and 2nd place earned spots at
the Invitational. They also both got to take home lovely Narset and Oko baseball trophy
cards! Sean Soderman clinched the top spot on the absurdly powerful Jewel PO deck, while
Stu squeaked in at 2nd on Esper Tinker.

We’ll have more details for the 2023 Invitational shortly, but it’ll be Saturday,
December 2nd at Tweedy’s! Our 10 Invitees will be playing many, many rounds of Vintage
and Middle School. We’ll stream the whole thing if you wanna catch it from your couch,
but if you’re local, please come hang out in person – we’d love to see you!

After that we’ll be onto the 2024 Season, which we’re kicking off with a bang...
more to come on that soon...
