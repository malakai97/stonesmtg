RTS35 was our final open event of the season. We returned to ABW’s new Springdale
location, where we had a ton of tables to ourselves. With 25 players, it was perfect.

Per tradition as the last event of the year, RTS35 was a double qualifier: 1st *and* 2nd
place both earned invites to the Invitational, as well as trophy cards. In this case it
was a Mox Sapphire to complete the lo-fi playset we’ve given out this season, as well as
a Lotus Petal:

Since the last tournament the format has continued to consolidate around Esper Lurrus.
Rob Wilson, of Buffalo Chicken Dip Legacy fame, drove out from Houston and went on an
undefeated sweep with Lurrus. Ian Files, who’s showed up in damn near every top 8 this
season, drew with him in the finals so that Rob could start his long drive home, rather
than forcing themselves into an hours-long Esper mirror. Cheers to Rob and Ian for
earning themselves seats at the Invitational!

The Fall Semester League Top 8 is playing out this coming week. After that we have a few
small events in November, and then the Invitational on Dec 7. It’s been a great season,
and we’re excited to celebrate with y’all in a few weeks!
