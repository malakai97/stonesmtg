The Dance Party is routinely our biggest Middle School event of the season, and
this year’s was no exception: we had 48 players, good for 6 rounds and 6 weeks
of Middle School.

The top 8 was quite diverse and spicy, with rogue decks like Mirari’s Wake,
Naya Zoo, and Living Death Zombie Infestation. That wasn’t the only exciting
story, though: Matt Perlman won the whole thing on Pink Weenie Tax Rack
[one year after doing exactly that in the 2024 Dance Party](https://stonesmtg.com/results/2024-02-29/).
With his win, Matt not only earned
himself a spot at this year’s Invitational, but also joined the extremely
exclusive ranks of Lorien Elleman and Rob Connolly as the only players who have
won more than one Stones league!

Slops for the league: players did *extremely* poorly on deck photo submissions
this time. Like, half of our players didn’t send in decklists. I was able to
comb through discord posts to find a good chunk of the missing ones, but that’s
an annoying process. Please, don’t make me do that. As it stands, we’re missing
decklists/photos for 1/3 of the players in this league. RTS is one of the only
repositories of Middle School decklists; getting lists every league is a huge
deal for us and this format. Email in your fuckin’ deck photos next time,
dudes.

Anyway, we should be back with a league in the next few months – it’s a busy
time for our TOs and our stream guru recently had a baby, so everyone’s
attention is spread thin. But we’re also all excited about the format, so
dammit, School will be Out soon!
