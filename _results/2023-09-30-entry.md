Romancing the Stones has entered its 30s! Thirteen players came out to
celebrate with us at Austin Beerworks’s new Springdale location. We had beer,
cake,
restricted cards, and even physical copies of our first 15 posters to give away!

Mike O’Malley once again demonstrated his skill at tapping Bazaar of Baghdad,
taking down the whole thing and earning himself a spot at this year’s
Invitational and an amazing Karn baseball card. Special shoutout to spicy tech Become
Immense.

We’ll hopefully have the Fall Semester Middle School League running in the
next few weeks, and should be announcing RTS31 Vintage for November.
