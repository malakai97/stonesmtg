After a frigid Festival of Friendship, we were excited to host Romancing The
Stones 36 on Kinda Tropical’s sunny patio! In the week leading up to RTS36
Austin was cold and wet, though, so we had a last-minute panic and switched
venues to Austin Beerworks. Fortunately, we love ABW and it worked out great:
we had plenty of space for our players, with lots of good beer options for
everyone.

We had a stellar 32-player turnout! After years of hovering at 16-24 players,
it really feels like we’re picking up momentum in 2025. Thanks to everyone both
for evangelizing our events, and for coming out to play.

Speaking of evangelizing, for the RTS36 trophy we had a beautiful playset of
Evangelion-themed Doomsdays! Bobby has really been crushing the trophies this
season, with a diversity of really creative ideas.

Aetherdrift saw a handful of really impactful printings slide into Vintage.
Stock Up looks like a strong new blue card advantage and selection tool a la
Dig Through Time, while Momentum Breaker is really strong in PO shells. We saw
both these cards in several of our Top 8 lists, as well as new Shops tools like
Glaring Fleshraker and Scrawling Crawler.

Our Top 8 was nicely diverse, with nary a Lurrus Control, Dredge, or Oath list
in site. Paul Garrett took it down with his trusty Underworld Breach, now fully
Stocked Up. Enjoy the Doomsdays, Paul, and welcome to the 2025 Invitational!

The Dance Party League is well underway and will be keeping us entertained for
a few more weeks. After that we’ll take a short break for spring break and
SXSW, and should be back with more Vintage in late March or early April.
