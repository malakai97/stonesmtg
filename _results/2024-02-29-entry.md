After an [unintentionally-long hiatus from Middle School](https://stonesmtg.com/results/2023-08-17/),
the Dance Party brought us back to 2003 in full force. There was pent-up demand for the format, as we
had 48 players register – our second-largest event ever. Notably, we also saw our biggest international
turnout with 6 Japanese players reporting. And boy oh boy did they convert, with 4 of them making Top 8.

Congrats to newcomer Matt Perlman for taking it down on Pink Weenie Tax Rack!
This league was an interesting reaction to the graveyard renaissance that was
the School’s Out league. 2 very different Tax/Rack decks made it to the finals,
and the rest of Top 8 was quite fair; the highest-placing graveyard combo deck was
Worldgorger in 9th. What does this mean for the meta moving forward? Who knows.

We intend to be back much sooner than last time – keep your eyes out for the next league this spring!
