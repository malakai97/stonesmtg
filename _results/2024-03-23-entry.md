If there’s something better than playing Vintage at an outdoor bar in March in Austin,
we haven’t experienced it. Apparently our local Magic players agree: 32 players came out
for RTS32, making this **our biggest paper Vintage event to date!** It’s hard to
overstate how much this means. We’re five years into Romancing The Stones, we’ve seen
players relocate to other states, dramatic power creep, card prices increase, a
pandemic that drove people away, etc etc, so to suddenly break our own attendance
record and have a truly big tournament is heartening. And there’s also the innocent
joy that we had 32 players for RTS32 on 3/23!

In addition to the great turnout, we had a few notable innovations and surprises. Rob
Connolly continues to push the envelop on our stream capabilities, and set up a mobile
recording station! We recorded a match each round, which we plan to edit and release.
Likewise, John Thomas created a custom card in honor of the coming eclipse:
Total Solar Eclipse!

This was our first event since the Ponder unrestriction, so it was interesting see what
folks could do with 4 of them (spoiler: not much). It was a rough day for Dredge and,
compared to its dominance in our last couple events, a weaker day for Jewel Shops.
Piloting on the other end of the strategy spectrum, Houston Shops guru Ben Kendrick
played Golos all the way to first!

We don’t have a specific date for RTS33 yet, but after the incredible day we want to
build on that momentum and have it soon!
