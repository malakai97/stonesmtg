Romancing the Stones celebrated the summer solstice with RTS38 at Tweedy’s! We
had a healthy 29 players, which made for good competitive vibes and 5 great
rounds of Vintage.

Our streaming guru Rob Connolly has been AWOL since his baby daughter was born
this winter, but he finally emerged from his house covered in diapers and
spitup to record the whole tournament on his mobile rig – and he even made top
8 in the process! Once he chops up the video, he’ll be streaming it on our
Twitch for everyone to enjoy. Good to have ya back, Rob.

Bobby provided us with an incredible Clippy Null Rod trophy playset. The
grab-bag approach to trophies this season has let him run wild, and it’s been
great to see what he cooks up.

Coming off NYSE the weekend before we expected a lot more PO than we actually
saw. Instead we got a really diverse Top 8 with strong pilots on a bunch of
different strategies.

Caleb Ray took it down with Dredge – his second win of the season! Because he
already qualified, his finalist opponent Ben Kendrick earned himself a spot at
the 2025 Invitational. Nice work, gentlemen.

We just kicked off Round 1 of the School’s Out League, which will be our
primary focus for the summer. That said, keep your eyes peeled for
announcements – we just might be going back to Houston soon...
