RTS34 saw us back at Conan’s for the retro vibe. We had 21 players eating pizza,
surrounded by Frazetta’s glory.

Ryan Bartley made Mana Crypt dice as a giveaway for everyone! Despite all the bans in
EDH-world, but Crypt is evergreen in Vintage. Thanks Ryan for being an amazing community
member.

With Saga gone, Wasteland took over the format. 7 of our Top 8 were on Wasteland and/or
Strip Mine. *Hide your lands, hide your wife.* We also saw a consolidation around
Initiative (with 2 Mono White, 1 Tinker, and 1 Shops Initiative), and Lurrus (with 1 UB
and 2 Esper).

The finals were wonderful! Newcomer Alex Avance brought a spicy Jeskai Breach list
featuring Sevinne’s Reclamation, while Chase Hoppe (of The OK Land Run fame) piloted the
feared UB Lurrus to victory. Congrats, Chase, on the Mox Ruby trophy and a spot at the
2024 Invitational.
