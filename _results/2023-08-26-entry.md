Last year we partnered with the Falling Stars to organize Hurricane Weekend, an
Old School and Vintage double-header in Houston. It was a blast, and before the
weekend was even over we knew we wanted to make it a recurring event. So this
past weekend, the Hurricane returned!

On Friday players started trickling in from around Texas, Oklahoma, Las Vegas,
Colorado, and New Jersey. The Austin gang rented a big townhouse in Montrose,
and once we’d dropped our stuff off we met our Houston friends for drinks at
The Toasted Coconut. Then we all regrouped at the Airbnb for Beta Draft,
Vintage Cube, and rooftop hangs.

Saturday morning we filtered to Rudyard’s Pub for Old School. 40 players came
out to Strip Mine each other and enjoy some old cardboard. Falling Stars Simon
and Winston put on a hell of a show: they were excellent TOs, and through their
raffling skills we raised $2350 for the Houston Food Bank.

Sunday was *supposed* to be the Stones’ show, but an unforeseen emergency
summoned Tweedy and Stu back to Austin, so Simon stepped up and ran Vintage for
us. We owe Simon a huge thank you for his energy over the whole weekend: he was
a tireless planner and host, and the Hurricane really was his feat his year.

We had 24 players for Vintage – our biggest event of the season! Houston
local Bo took it down on Oath, earning himself Wrenn & Six baseball trophy and
an Invitational spot. (The aforementioned emergency meant that Stu wasn’t
there to diligently collect lists or take notes, hence this report’s
barebones style. Sorry y’all – guess we’ll rely on pictures telling a
thousand words.)

The Hurricane exceeded all our expectations. We’ll see you in 2024, Houston!
