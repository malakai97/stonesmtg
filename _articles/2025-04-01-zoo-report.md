I just finished a semifinals run in the 2025 Dance Party League with, of all
things, Naya Zoo. This was one of my most fun and expectedly strong League
performances, so I wanted to document the event and share thoughts on the deck
while it’s still fresh in my mind.

**Background**

When we started running local MS monthlies a few years ago, I wanted to build
some new decks so that I wouldn’t be Sligh Player Number 4 and turn people off
of the format. That started with Counter Rebels, and then Zoo. Ty Thomason is
one of my favorite deck designers and
[played Zoo in a league a few years ago](https://tysmtgblog.blogspot.com/2022/12/naya-zoo-in-middle-school.html)
so I modified his list off his
suggestions and tried it out as a fun back-pocket deck.

In my first outing I went 3-0 and was convinced Zoo was great. Over the next
two months, I went 0-3 and 1-2. Fickle mage that I am, I wrote the deck off as
cute and bad.

Late last year, I began selling off a large chunk of my collection to both pare
down and fund a Timetwister. Naya Zoo was on the chopping block . . .

. . . and fortunately, I didn’t have any takers! So if I couldn’t get rid of
the cards, that meant I needed to play them.

**League Report**

I hope this won’t be the only tournament report on this league, because the Top
8 was spicy and I’d love to get some other players’ perspectives.

Here’s the 75 I played:

![]({{site.cdn_url}}/assets/images/stuzoo/zoo_list.jpg)


Round 1: Andrew Webb - Parfait Oath
*	Round 1 of the league coincided with our monthly MS tournament in Austin.
    That night I played Counter Rebels to a crushing 1-3 finish, the only win
    being a bye! Immediately after Webb and I grabbed a table for our league
    match.
*	Game 1: I had no idea what Webb was on, but when he opened with Diamond +
    Land Tax I put him on his Tax Tog deck he’s pioneered. However, he quickly
    after assembled Land Tax and Ivory Tower, and I scooped. When it was
    apparent I couldn’t keep up with the life gain, I scooped.
*	Game 2: After two hands without lands I kept Savannah Lions, Seal of
    Cleansing x2, Land x2. As far as 5-card hands go against Parfait, you could
    do a lot worse. However, I drew 5 lands in a row while Webb got his engine
        assembled. It was late on a worknight at this point, so I conceded.
*	Vibe Check: An inauspicious start to the league! You never like to begin an
    event with a loss, but it’s especially psychologically hard in a 6-week
    league, where you know you’ll have to spend the next month trying to battle
    back.
*	Match Record: 0-2
*	League Record: 0-1

Round 2: Tim Baran – OathStill
*	Tim is based in the Midwest, so I set up my webcam in my garage. It was
    still cold in Austin and I had an oatmeal stout while we played.
*	Game 1: I fell into the trap of keeping 7 cards where the only land was a
    single Gemstone Mine: I was too excited by seeing multiple Lions and a
    Rancor. I quickly used up all the gem counters and didn’t draw another
    land, so didn’t cast more than 3 spells. Dumb aggro player!
*	Game 2: I led on a Lion and proceeded to draw 4 different Disenchant
    effects, removal for Tim’s manlands, and more threats. This was the first
    match showcasing what good Zoo hands are capable of: a blazingly fast clock
    with perfect spot answers.
*	Game 3: Tim mulled to 5, while I kept a hand with Jackal Pup, Plow, REB,
    and Wax/Wane. I continued drawing action, and he died pretty quickly.
*	Vibe Check: I felt pretty good coming out of this match – you’re always
    happy to beat Oath when you’re a creature deck. In the postboard games my
    deck served up exactly what I needed at the right moment – lots of timely
    Plows, Seals, and Wanes.
*	Match Record: 2-1
*	League Record: 1-1

Round 3: Rajah James - Yang Burn
*	It had been a while since Rajah and I played: he’s the Vintage Champ, so
    we’re usually on opposite ends of the standings! Earlier in the league
    Rajah mentioned he was on Burn, so I was nervous: the last time he played
    it he had an undefeated run in the swiss, and his list featured maindeck
    Cave In and Price of Progress against my deck’s 1-toughness creatures and
    20 nonbasics.
*	Game 1: I lucked into a hand with 0 painlands that put 2 Lions on the board
    – already the best I can ask for. Rajah and I threw a Chain of Plasma back
    and forth, with me hitting him for 6. Unfortunately for him I had also
    drawn double Bolt, which killed him before he could kill me.
*	Game 2: I kept Fanatic, Lion, Rancor, Absolute Law, Bolt, and 2 Lands –
    quite strong against him. Rajah opened on Seal of Fire, which he burned on
    my turn 1 Fanatic. On turn 2 I made Absolute Law, then on turn 3 made a
    Pro-Red 4/1 Trampling Lion. This was already very scary, but I had also
    drawn 2 more Bolts in the meantime, so I had lethal very quickly.
*	Vibe Check: Going into the match I thought I was heavily unfavored, so a
    decisive win in 2 was invigorating. I felt bad for Rajah: not only were my
    draws absurdly good, he also never saw a Cave In or Price of progress.
*	Match Record: 2-0
*	League Record: 2-1

Round 4: Takuya Kawakubo - Esper Shadowmage
*	Our Japanese contingent probably has the best win-rate of all our players,
    and if I get paired against one of them I get nervous. Takuya’s no
    exception: he’s Top 8’d many of the leagues he’s joined. I wasn’t sure what
    to put him on – in the past he’s played Slivers and Bant Threshold, so I
    figured I should prioritize hands with Plow and hope for the best.
*	Game 1: I kept a 1-lander, but Takuya’s deck was slow midrange control and
    couldn’t punish me for it. Once I drew another land the game became threat
    after threat, and Takuya was stuck on the back foot.
*	Game 2: I kept Pup, Legionnaire, Winter Orb x2, and Land x3. Normally I
    don’t love keeping 3 lands in a 7 card hand, but I felt that Winter Orb was
    my best card in the matchup, so having redundancy was good. This worked out
    well: I drew lands, removal, and threats in the right order, and he could
    never get anything going.
*	Vibe Check: prior to this round I felt like my deck was overperforming
    against terrible pairings – being on a weenie deck with painlands, Oath and
    Burn sounded terrible. At this point, my mindset started to shift: Takuya’s
    deck is probably my absolute best matchup, but even the others weren’t as
    bad as I originally thought. The thing I realized at this point is that
    other than Rajah, no one’s decks were punishing my weaknesses (painlands,
    small creatures, Wastelandable manabase). Add to that that I kept drawing
    draw hot, and my confidence started to grow.
*	Match Record: 2-0
*	League Record: 3-1

Round 5: Patrick Vincent – Landstill
*	I’ve played more Magic against Pat than probably anyone else, which has
    included tons of Sligh vs Landstill. He’s gotten to be very adept at
    beating me with Landstill, so I was nervous for this match. On paper I
    should be favored – Winter Orb Aggro is objectively bad for UW Control –
    but I could picture all types of Powder Keg, Wrath, Plow, Angel, Humility,
    and Decree hands that would ruin me. We decided to play our match at the
    March monthly MS event, in which I went 0-2 drop on Rebels – it’s Round 1
    all over again!
*	Game 1: I was on the play and kept 2 Lions, 2 lands, and 3 removal spells.
    This lined up perfectly: Pat kept a hand based off 2 Factory, and when I
    was able to kill both with Plow/Bolt, he could never really recover.
*	Game 2: I kept a hand with threats and Winter Orb x2. I resolved them and
    attacked him down to 4 life. He tapped out for an Exalted Angel, but I had
    a Fanatic and Bolt to finish him off before he could untap with it.
*	Vibe Check: The deck has drawn absurdly hot 8 games in a row, and I start
    to think there might be something here. I also learned that Patrick was
    experimenting with cutting Wastelands for Dust Bowls, contributing yet
    again to the meta not punishing my greed.
*	Match Record: 2-0
*	League Record: 4-1

**Round 6: Lorien Elleman – Enchantress**
*	Lorien’s another fearsome player who has won multiple leagues on different
    decks, so I didn’t know what to expect. It was also daylight savings,
    making everything feel wonky. I opened a Hopadillo and hoped for the best.
*	Game 1: Lorien led on a Wild Growth, so right away I knew what was up. I
    did Zoo stuff and got him near lethal, but he got his engine online and
    assembled Solitary Confinement + Sterling Grove. I needed at least 2 Wanes
    and had 0, so I scooped.
*	Game 2: I had a very fast start but Lorien kept a defensive hand that
    slowed me down a lot, throwing away Solitary Confinement as Fog and then
    assembling Humility + Squirrel Nest for blockers. However, Winter Orb
    slowed him down, so he had to use his one untap every turn on making
    squirrels, not casting spells. I also stuck 2 Rancors to threats, which
    thanks to layering still grants trample under Humility, so I could get
    damage in over the Squirrels.
*	Game 3: I mulled to 5, keeping Lion,
    Rancor, and Simoon. I was able to Simoon his Enchantress and then drew a
    timely Wane for his Solitary, so I got across the line without him going
    off.
*	Vibe Check: I had all the tools to beat Enchantress, but it still
    felt like with other draws I could have been completely steamrolled, so
    winning the match felt great. I was also about to leave for spring break in
    Paris, adding to the good energy.
*	Match Record: 2-1
*	League Record: 5-1

**Interim: Top 8 began playing out while I was in Paris. Lorien and I were
paired up again for the quarterfinals, which I felt OK about – I knew I could
win the matchup. On my side of the bracket Pete Simpson’s Zombie
Infestation/Living Death deck defeated Kai on Mono U Stiflenaight. On the other
side of the bracket, Webb (Parfait) defeated Mike Simpson (Goblins), while Matt
Perlman’s Pink Tax Rack defeated Tweedy’s Mirari’s Wake Control.

Vibe Check: While I wasn’t sure what to think of my quarters and semis
opponents (powerful, fast combo, but again not punishing my weaknesses), the
finals was going to be sketchy for me either way: it would either be Parfait
Oath, or Devastating Dreams Tax Rack. To win, I’d just need to draw well and my
opponents to not draw well, which had been the story of the league so far!

**Quarters: Lorien Elleman – Enchantress**
*	I was back from Paris and Lorien was back from GaryCon, so we set up on a
    Monday night for our rematch. I cracked an Icy Boys and got ready to
    manifest some Disenchant effects.
*	Game 1: I kept 2 threats, 2 Rancors, a Wane, and 2 lands – probably the
    best hand I could ask for, and I was on the play! And that’s how it played
    out – I killed him incredibly quickly while disrupting him. Winning game 1
    felt huge.
*	Game 2: I took out 2 Guildmage and 4 Plow, and brought in 2 Simoon and 4
    Seal of Cleansing. I assembled a very aggressive board quickly. Lorien made
    a turn 2 Enchantress into turn 3 Earthcraft, but missed a land drop. I
    decided to use my Wane on his Earthcraft, figuring it would either limit
    his mana or prevent him comboing me out of nowhere. Unfortunately, he
    played a Solitary Confinement with cards to fuel it, shutting down my
    lethal board and letting him go off.
*	Game 3: My mull to 6 showed me Lion, Wane x 2, Orb, Simoon, and Land x2. I
    decided to bottom the Simoon rather than Orb and hope it would be the more
    effective card. On his turn 1 Lorien made a Forest into Exploration into
    Sanctum, then passed. I Waned the Exploration to make Sanctum tap for 0,
    which felt strong. On his turn Lorien made another enchantment, which I
    Waned again and then cast Orb. This was a good position to be in, except
    that I still only had 1 threat so the clock wasn’t fast. Eventually I drew
    more threats and got him down to 2, at which point he made a Solitary
    Confinement. We sweated for a few turns of him drawing off Enchantress and
    discarding to Solitary, but then I topdecked a Seal of Cleansing, killed
    Solitary, and attacked for lethal.
*	Vibe Check: 7 Disenchant effects. This deck has served me everything I
    want, right when I want it.
*	Match Record: 2-1
*	League Record: 6-1

**Semis: Pete Simpson – Living Death Zombie Infestation**
*	In the 24 hours between our matches I managed to psych myself out about
    Pete’s deck. Other than Waning a Zombie Infestation, in game 1 there isn’t
    much I can do against him. And postboard he has access to 4 removal spells,
    4 Engineered Plague (solid on Cat), and 2 Dystopia. I made a margarita and
    reminded myself that if I drew hot and he drew poorly, I could get there.
*	Game 1: Pete was on the play and made a turn 2 Zombie Infestation,
    discarding Squee x2 and a Krovikan Horror – so much for him drawing poorly!
    For a few turns I sort of held him off and got in some damage with a
    Rancored Lion that a Guildmage was giving first strike, but I didn’t see a
    Wane and eventually he had too many Zombies.
*	Game 2: I cut 1 Guildmage, 2 Plow, and 3 Winter Orb (quite bad vs Lake of
    the Dead and Peat Bog) and brought in 3 Seal of Cleansing and 3 Tormod’s
    Crypt. Pete mulled to 4 – maybe him drawing poorly *was* on the menu! He
    kept a hand with double Phyrexian Arena to draw back in, but I had a Wane
    and a Seal for both.
*	Game 3: My 7 is Land x 2, Creature x3, Rancor, and Seal. I waffled on this
    – it’s fast and handles a weak Zombie Infestation, but is dead to the
    Laquatus/Living Death combo. After a minute I decided that I didn’t want to
    lose the league by keeping an inappropriate 7, and to tried to mull to a 6
    with Tormod’s. Pete kept his 7 while my 6 was Pup x2, Rancor, and Land x4.
    I shipped that, and 5 showed me Plow x 2, Seal of Fire x 1, Seal of
    Cleansing, land x 3 – a hand that can’t win the game and is still dead to
    the combo. I mulled that, and kept a 4 of Mogg Fanatic, Bolt, Plow, City of
    Brass. Pete said Swamp go, then Peat Bog go, then Buried Alive for
    Laquatuses with another Peat Bog, then turn 4 Living Death. I was able to
    Bolt 1 Laquatus and Plow another, so I didn’t *die* to the combo, but I was
    still at 10 with no board against a 6/3. I died.
*	Vibe Check: my luck finally ran out! I wasn’t upset about the loss – I
    didn’t know what to expect out of the matchup, and after so many matches of
    my deck delivering the goods, it was bound to happen. Likewise, none of the
    hands I mulled in game 3 would have beaten what Pete did unless I topdecked
    a Crypt, so I didn’t really mull myself out of the game.
*	Match Record: 1-2
*	League Record: 6-2


**Notes on the Deck**

Naya has always been my favorite shard: I think because it lacks Blue and Black
– classically the strongest, spikiest colors - only playing GRW has this great
underdog feeling. That’s a terrible competitive reason to play a deck, but it
was quite rewarding. Sometimes, it’s also just fun to put three 2/1s on the
board and see what happens.

6-2 exceeded my expectations, and at times Zoo felt unbeatable, but really this
is a meta deck and a lot of luck went into the performance. As I’ve said
throughout this report, Zoo has a lot of weaknesses that are easy to exploit.
It was extremely improbable that over eight rounds, it never once mattered how
much damage my lands did to me or that my guys all die to every piece of
removal in the format. This is not me telling you to avoid the deck, but I
don’t think Zoo can/should become a big part of the meta.

The big takeaways and plans after the league are:
* If your opponents can’t punish you, this deck is insane.
* Wax/Wane and Seal of Cleansing were my MVPs. More broadly, the 12 Lions and
  all the spells were strong. Rancor is an incredible clock; Plow is always
  good; the burn is really flexible as both removal and clock; Winter Orbs are
  punishing against a lot of decks; and the SB cards were all relevant. Couple
  that with putting 4-6 power on the board by turn 2, and a lot of decks will
  struggle against your gameplan.
* Legionnaire, Fanatic, and Guildmage underperformed. I don’t want to overthink
  this, though, because my matchups were entirely creatureless, and that’s very
  unlikely.
* I’m not convinced this deck needs changes. However, the next time I play it I
  think I will turn the 2 Guildmages into 2 Incinerates – it’s a more flexible
  card that is live in every match. I am also thinking about replacing
  Legionnaire with another 2 drop: Wild Mongrel is probably the choice, though
  River Boa and Mogg Flunkies are fun ideas too.
* Both Ty and Tweedy have mentioned the idea of adding a 3 drop. I could see a
  couple Call of the Herd or Anurid Brushhopper being good additions.
* The Ice Age Pyroblast should really become a Fifth Edition Pyroblast to get
  more white borders in there.
* When I register this deck again, I will keep a tracker for how many times I
  accidentally call Wax/Wane “Wear/Tear.”
